## 🔧 Processing Transformations

### Image Processing Steps
```
1. INPUT: Raw dermatoscopic image (various sizes)
   ↓
2. HAIR REMOVAL: DullRazor algorithm
   - Convert to grayscale
   - Apply black-hat morphology (17×17 kernel)
   - Threshold hair detection (threshold=10)
   - Inpaint hair regions
   ↓
3. SEGMENTATION (for 'seg' variant only):
   - Gaussian blur (5×5)
   - Otsu automatic thresholding
   - Find largest contour (lesion)
   - Create binary mask
   - Apply mask to original image
   ↓
4. STANDARDIZATION:
   - Resize to 224×224 pixels
   - Normalize using ImageNet stats
   - Save as processed image
```

### Dual Output Strategy
```
Each Original Image → 2 Processed Variants:

📸 ORIGINAL VARIANT ('orig'):
- Hair removal ✓
- Resize to 224×224 ✓  
- Background preserved
- Full context available

🎯 SEGMENTED VARIANT ('seg'):
- Hair removal ✓
- Resize to 224×224 ✓
- Background removed
- Focus on lesion only
```

## 🚀 Model Training Readiness

### Training Pipeline Integration
```python
# Load processed dataset
df = pd.read_csv('processed_data.csv')

# Split by patient (avoid data leakage)
train_df = df[df['lesion_id'].isin(train_patients)]
val_df = df[df['lesion_id'].isin(val_patients)]

# Create dataloaders using clean_path column
train_dataset = SkinCancerDataset(train_df, transform=train_transforms)
val_dataset = SkinCancerDataset(val_df, transform=val_transforms)
```

### Recommended Training Strategy
```
1. 🏗️  MODEL ARCHITECTURE:
   - EfficientNet-B0 (recommended) or ResNet-50
   - Pre-trained on ImageNet (transfer learning)
   - Custom classifier head for 7 classes

2. ⚖️  CLASS BALANCE:
   - WeightedRandomSampler for training
   - OR Focal Loss / Class-weighted CrossEntropy
   - Focus on malignant class performance

3. 📊 EVALUATION:
   - Per-class precision, recall, F1-score
   - Confusion matrix analysis
   - ROC-AUC for each class
   - Special focus on malignant classes

4. 🔄 TRAINING LOOP:
   - Use both 'orig' and 'seg' variants
   - Compare variant performance
   - Early stopping on validation loss
   - Save best model by malignant class F1-score
```

### Expected Performance Benefits
```
✅ Hair Removal:      Reduces confounding artifacts
✅ Standardization:   Enables transfer learning
✅ Dual Variants:     Provides both context + focus
✅ Class Doubling:    Helps minority class learning
✅ Medical Focus:     Preserves diagnostic features
